# About The Seed Engine
The Seed Engine is a rather ambitious project of two university studients. We are working on this during the assigment of *Game Engine Development* for the CITM degree in Video Game Design and Development.

The Seed is a tuple of two university students with a game engine project.
The Seed engine was developed by Biel Rabasa and Roger Salas in 2022-23.

**Biel Rabasa**

I played videogames during my entire childhood, but i never knew that was what i would be doing when I grew up. I learned to program while being at school, and my passion for this sector has always brought me to it, so being able to connect videogames with it is probably the best decision I made.
I'm passionate about data management, optimisation, entity pipelines and code management, so this project has been ideal to learn more about it.

· In this project I have contributed to:
   - Game Object functionality
   - All Component functionalities
   - Render pipeline
   - Game Object and Components pipeline
   - Cameras, Meshes, Textures and Shaders
   - Importing files (textures, meshes, shaders)
   - Shader pipeline, default shaders & inspector
   - Scene movement
   - Demo scene and water shader

I have always liked videogames, and for a few years before entering to study a career on them, I also like programming. At the beginning, and for lack of another method, I started with Unity but there were many things that I did not understand. That is why having the opportunity to do this project, I have been able to learn a lot and understand more thoroughly the things that I used when programming. I have also been able to come to see how complex everything is and now I am beginning to see what can really be done and that I am not that far away.

 · In this project I have contributed to:
   - Each window of the engine
   - Console: show Logs and Errors in the engine
   - Assets: show the files and folders in the Assets folder and open files
   - Hierarchy: show and select the gameObjects in the scene and their children
   - Inspector: show the components of the gameObject selected, where you can add more components and modify the variables
   - Configuration: in this window you cna find some specifications of the engine and adjust some parameters
   - Main Menu: some options tu use the engine, the play system
   - Shader Editor: Load, edit, create, save and recompilate the shader you want
   - Game: show the game with the POV of the game camera
   - Scene: you can see the scene and modify, you can select a gameObject clicking them
