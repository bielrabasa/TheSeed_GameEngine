# About The Seed
The Seed Engine is unfinished, we are working on this during the assigment of *Game Engine Development* for the CITM degree in Video Game Design and Development.

The Seed Engine is a game engine developed in C++ using the external libraries: 

&emsp; -&emsp;*[SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)*

&emsp; -&emsp;*[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)* 

&emsp; -&emsp;*[ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)*

&emsp; -&emsp;*[GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/)*

&emsp; -&emsp;*[DevIL](https://openil.sourceforge.net/)*

&emsp; -&emsp;*[MathGeoLib](https://github.com/juj/MathGeoLib)*

I have always liked videogames, and for a few years before entering to study a career on them, I also like programming. At the beginning, and for lack of another method, I started with Unity but there were many things that I did not understand. That is why having the opportunity to do this project, I have been able to learn a lot and understand more thoroughly the things that I used when programming. I have also been able to come to see how complex everything is and now I am beginning to see what can really be done and that I am not that far away.

 Â· In this project I have contributed to:
   - Each window of the engine
   - Console: show Logs and Errors in the engine
   - Assets: show the files and folders in the Assets folder and open files
   - Hierarchy: show and select the gameObjects in the scene and their chills
   - Inspector: show the components of the gameObject selected, you can add more components and modify the variables
   - Configuration: in this window you finde some specifications of the engine and ajust some parameters
   - Main Menu: some options tu use the engine, the play system
   - Shader Editor: Load, edit, create, save and recompilate the shader you wnat
   - Game: show the game with the POV of the game camera
   - Scene: you can see the scene and modify, you can select a gameObject clicking them
